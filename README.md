This project is a Netflix Clone built using HTML and CSS. It is designed to replicate the look and feel of Netflix's homepage, providing a basic layout with movies and TV shows, styled similarly to Netflix's interface.

Features
Responsive Design: While it is optimized for larger screens (like laptops), the responsiveness for mobile devices is a work in progress.
Content Layout: Displays various sections for movies and TV shows, using grid layouts and carousel-style sections.
Minimalist Design: A clean and modern layout mimicking Netflixâ€™s visual style.

Technologies Used
HTML: Used to structure the content of the webpage.
CSS: Used for styling, including layout, fonts, and animations.

Challenges
Optimizing the design for mobile screens was one of the challenges faced during this project, as the project was built with a focus on desktop view.

Future Improvements
Implement responsive design techniques for better performance on mobile devices.
Enhance the user interface with additional features like hover effects and interactive elements.
